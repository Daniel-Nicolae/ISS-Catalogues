# ISS-Catalogues

Full title:
Using statistical methods to populate catalogues with missing data

The aim was to design a statistical method for generating data samples that match with the distribution of the other data in astronomical catalogues, in order to populate certain areas of the sky where observation was impossible (e.g., in the galactic plane).
